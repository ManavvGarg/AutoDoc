## AutoDoc Documentation

**Introduction**

AutoDoc is a tool that helps you automatically document your projects. It simplifies the process of capturing API documentation, generating file lists, and saving project information for easy reference.

**Getting Started**

1. Download the AutoDoc Application
2. Use the Application and Select your directory to automatically document your code.

**API Reference**

Currently, AutoDoc does not have a formal API defined.

**Function Definitions**

- `generate()`: Generates documentation and saves it to the `docs` directory.
- `list_project_files()`: Recursively iterates over the project directory and returns a list of files and directories.
- `save_file(filename, content)`: Saves the given content to the specified filename.

**Additional Notes**

- The documentation is automatically generated and updated when you the `generate()` function is run.

**Further Development**

AutoDoc is still in its early stages of development. We encourage you to contribute ideas and suggestions to help us improve the tool.
